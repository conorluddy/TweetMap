Twitter stream heat map experiment

This is a small application which stores tweets from the Twitter streaming API into a MySQL database table, where they can then be plotted on a google map to give a "heatmap" type result.

The Twitter stream is filtered by latitude and longitude, currently configured to return Tweets from Ireland.
